/**
 * Defines the logical connection type between Guidelines, specifically how one Guideline's
 * activation influences another.
 *
 * The connection itself is always entailed (logically follows), but this enum determines
 * whether the target Guideline's action should be treated as mandatory or just suggestive.
 *
 * Values:
 * "entails": Indicates that when the source Guideline is activated, the target
 * Guideline's action must be executed. This represents a strong, mandatory
 * logical implication.
 *
 *     "suggests": While the logical connection still exists, this marker indicates that the
 *              target Guideline's action should be considered but isn't mandatory. It serves
 *              as a logical hint rather than a requirement.
